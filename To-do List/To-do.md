Project Title: To-Do List Website

Project Description:

The To-Do List Website is a user-friendly and interactive web application that allows users to organize and manage their tasks and responsibilities effectively. Built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides an intuitive and visually appealing platform for users to create, update, and track their to-do items.

Key Features:

• Task Creation and Management:

Users can easily create new tasks by entering task names and optional descriptions. 

• Real-time Updates:

JavaScript is utilized to enable real-time updates without requiring a page refresh. When users mark tasks as complete or modify task details, the interface dynamically reflects these changes, enhancing the user experience.

Users can mark tasks as completed, and these completed tasks can be visually differentiated from the pending ones.

• User-Friendly Interface:

The website boasts a clean and modern design achieved through CSS styling. The interface is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

• Data Persistence:

The project uses JavaScript to store task data locally, allowing users to access their to-do lists even after refreshing the page. This functionality enhances usability and ensures that users don't lose their tasks unintentionally.

• Interactive Elements:
Interactive elements like buttons, checkboxes, and drop-down menus make the website engaging and user-friendly. Users can easily toggle task completion status and perform actions like editing or deleting tasks.
